# Greedy_reduce
PHONG Q. NGUYEN,and DAMIEN STEHLÂ´E 's paper "Low-Dimensional Lattice Basis Reduction Revisited" ,fig4:Iterative-Greedy algorithm.

This routine is the implenment of the above algorithm, which aims to find the "shortest" vector in a low dimension lattice where the dimension is less than 4.

As the artical said, this greedy reduce algorithm performes better than LLL reduce while the dimension is less than 4.

The programe is based on NTL lib, please load it in advance.
