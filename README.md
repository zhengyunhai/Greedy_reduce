# Greedy_reduce
PHONG Q. NGUYEN,and DAMIEN STEHLÂ´E 's paper "Low-Dimensional Lattice Basis Reduction Revisited" ,fig4:Iterative-Greedy algorithm.

This routine is the implenment of the above algorithm, which aims to find the "shortest" vector in a low dimension lattice where the dimension is less than 4.

The programe is based on NTL lib, please load it in advance.
